# JTTracker
# Open Source Java Time Tracker build in Spring Boot with Nuxt.js

Following project was created inorder to learn modern web-dev technologies. 
During a team-driven and company-observed universaty project, I learnt how web-apps work, but sadly only with dated tech like thymeleaf and jquery. Since I already heard about Vue.js, there was no hasitation left and JTTracker was born. 

The idea of the app came from my always haunting question about another app I used during that universaty-project: Toggl. 
I always kept asking myself and others "How hard can it be to build something like Toggl?" and as I started this project, it turns out:  Not that easy, as it looks. Especially when working alone and learning a new Tech.  
# Keep in mind, this project was build as a "learning" and "portfolio" project. I have no intention on copying Toogl or other commercial-products.  

The whole project will be and stay Open-Source, since I want to learn and improve my skills threv community-feedback
Once bug-free and save, this project will be launched for testing purposes for some weeks or months. 

# To run JTTracker in a dev env. you need to have: 
    - NodeJS 12.X
    - OpenJDK 11.X
    - MariaDB:latest (optional)
# Folder-structure: 
    - Frontend: ./frontend
    - Backend: ./
# How to start: 
    1) Use the Terminal and type in "./mvnw spring-boot::run" to start the Sping-Server
    2) Navigate with the Terminal to ./frontend and launch the frontend with "npm run dev"
    Additionaly: If you are using MariaDB, then you need to launch it before the Spring-Server. 
    
# Docker: 
    I provided a docker-compose file for testing-purposes.
